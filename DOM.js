//Browser Environment - web
// JS became famous cuz it's the only language that runs on every browser.

//Browser - display a page/ html page
// 3 elements of the page 
//HTML - structure 
// CSS - Style 
// JS - Behavior
//ALL DATA is string and every tag become a object(that object is nodes)
// Browser sends HTTP request (TCP connection) send respone
//DOM - tree of nodes (Document object model)
//HTML data comes to browser with HTTP request and than one component browser converts those data into DOM (nodes tree) (Creation of the DOM) [Model logic]
//Other componet look at and  draws the DOM on the screen that is called (RENDERING DOM) [View Logic]
//User gesture(clicking, filling the form) [Controller logic]
// 3 logics = MVC 

//JS can touch DOM and create node and add node to DOM
//You can select any tag using the ID (document.getElementByID(x))
//Blocklevel text one div after other div = new line (Text come on new line)
//In-line text
//<div><span> - grouping text 
//<span> - in one line

//Position absolute - write top and left (works with div as parent)
//Position fixed - according to the browser
